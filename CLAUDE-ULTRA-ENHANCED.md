## üéØ REVOLUTIONARY TASK DECOMPOSITION SYSTEM

### **Intelligent Task Analysis Protocol**
For EVERY task, automatically analyze:

1. **Complexity Assessment**
   - Simple (1-2 steps): Execute immediately
   - Medium (3-5 steps): Use TodoWrite with dependencies
   - Complex (6+ steps): Break into phases with milestones

2. **Resource Requirements**
   - What MCPs are needed?
   - What files need to be read/modified?
   - What external research is required?

3. **Success Criteria Definition**
   - What constitutes completion?
   - How will we verify success?
   - What are the quality gates?

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the fallback strategies?
   - What dependencies exist?

### **Enhanced TodoWrite Protocol**
**Mandatory for ALL tasks >2 steps:**

```typescript
// Example Enhanced Todo Structure
{
  id: "unique-id",
  content: "Specific, measurable task description",
  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "blocked" | "completed",
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
  dependencies: ["task-id-1", "task-id-2"], // NEW
  tools_required: ["mcp__supabase__", "Read", "Edit"], // NEW
  success_criteria: "Specific completion criteria", // NEW
  estimated_complexity: 1-10, // NEW
  deadline: "ISO date string", // NEW
  blockers: ["description of what's blocking"], // NEW
}
```

**TodoWrite Usage Rules:**
