ðŸš€ **SISO ENHANCEMENT PROTOCOL**

Apply SISO enhancement patterns to: {{arg}}

**Enhancement Framework:**

1. **Performance Analysis**: 
   - Current performance metrics
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Optimization opportunities

2. **MUSK Algorithm Application**:
   - Question: Are all current features actually needed?
   - Delete: What can we remove or simplify?
   - Optimize: How can we make this 10x faster?
   - Automate: What manual processes can be automated?
   - Iterate: How can we test improvements rapidly?

3. **SISO Standards**:
   - First principles thinking
   - Zero-friction user experience
   - Maximum intelligence with minimum complexity
   - Revolutionary vs incremental improvements

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Atomic improvements
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Rollback safety
   - Performance validation

Use SISO development output style for technical implementation details.
